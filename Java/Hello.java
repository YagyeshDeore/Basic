// This is a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// It contains a main method which is the entry point of the program.
// The program uses the System.out.println() method to output the string to the console.
// The class is named Hello, and it is public, meaning it can be accessed from other classes.
// The main method is static, allowing it to be called without creating an instance of the class.
// The String[] args parameter allows for command-line arguments to be passed to the program.
// The program can be compiled and run using a Java compiler and runtime environment.
// To compile the program, use the command: javac Hello.java
// To run the program, use the command: java Hello
// The output will be: Hello, World!
// This program serves as a basic introduction to Java syntax and structure.
// It demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and the standard output stream.
// The program can be modified to print different messages or perform other tasks.
